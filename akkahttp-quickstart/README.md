# Akka HTTP Quickstart

This is the repo for the [free Akka HTTP Quickstart course](https://rebrand.ly/gh-akka-quickstart).

There's a branch per each video that involves writing code.

In this free course you will get your hands dirty and build a backend application for a todo list. You'll learn:

- How to use the Akka HTTP's routing DSL
- What directives are and how to create your own
- Parse your models to and from JSON
- Unit test your routes using the Akka HTTP's testkit

Hope you enjoy it!
